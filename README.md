👋 Hi there! I’m Kendall, a recent Computer Science graduate who loves hunting down inefficiencies and shipping elegant fixes.

- 🛠️  **What I build:**  
  • Security-focused tools and automation scripts  
  • GIS & spatial-analysis experiments (QuadTrees, GridFiles, shadow mapping)  
  • DevOps helpers that streamline CI/CD pipelines  

- 💡  **How I work:**  
  Research-driven, detail-oriented, and never afraid to lift the hood on complex systems—whether that’s optimizing data structures or debugging network configs.

- 🌱  **Currently exploring:**  
  • Cloud-native security (IaC scanning, policy as code)  
  • Rust for high-performance geo-apps  
  • Open-source contributions in cybersecurity tooling

- 🚀  **Fun facts:**  
  • Built a cottage water system and a garage from the ground up  
  • DIY car maintenance addict  
  • Coffee fuels my commit history ☕

> **Let’s connect.** If you see something interesting (or broken!) in my repos, open an issue or drop a PR—collaboration is the best part of coding.
